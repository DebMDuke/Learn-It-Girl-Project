Scholar Name: Garvita Sharma
Mentor: Debra Duke
Language: Java

Project details:
We aim to built a database oriented project. 
We plan to build a sort of active batch job which when 
executed automatically transfers data from one database 
to another database. The job will basically be the link
between the two or may be multiple databases.

Project Plan:
For the first week we had planned that I should explore the 
Github and we are on track. I have read multiple tutorials 
and I am still trying to get my hands on Github
The next week my mentor wants me to understand the basic concepts
of Java and differences between C++ and Java so that I can be well
versed with the language concepts and usability.
Then I would actually start coding and try to write basic small programs
in Java and then switching to big programs
which I can code in C++, I will try to code similar programs in Java.
Once I have the basic understanding of Java,
we plan to work towards the project, building
database and writing codes for the job linking the databases.
